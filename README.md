### Compiled Bootstrap 4 Alpha

Current version: Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2

Download: [click here](https://github.com/dmxt/bootstrap-4-alpha-compiled/releases)

Bootstrap v4 documentation: [click here](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/)

Since the download is unavailable on the official [Bootstrap 4 website](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com), I've made the compiled copy available on this repo. With prepared index and downloaded jquery file, you can start developing as soon as it is downloaded and extracted.

This repo includes the following files:
* `index.html`
* `css/bootstrap.min.css`
* `js/bootstrap.min.css`
* `js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js`
