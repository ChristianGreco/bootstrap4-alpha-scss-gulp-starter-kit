Since the download is unavailable on the official [Bootstrap 4 website](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/), I've made the compiled copy available on this repo. With prepared index and downloaded jquery file, you can start developing as soon as it is downloaded and extracted. It includes gulp with SCSS compiler, BrowserSync, error catcher and notifier, minifies \*.css files, etc.

If there's any issues or bugs related to this repo, plesae open an issue and I'll take a look.

Essential bootstrap files:
* `index.html`
* `css/bootstrap.min.css`
* `js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js`
* `js/bootstrap.min.css`
* `js/tender.min.js`
